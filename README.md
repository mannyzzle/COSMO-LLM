# Cosmo: AI-Powered Language Model for Space Analytics and Autonomous Satellite Operations

Cosmo is an AWS-based language model designed to revolutionize satellite fleet management and space missions. By leveraging Amazon S3 for large dataset storage, AWS SageMaker for scalable training, and AWS Lambda for real-time inference, Cosmo transforms astrophysical data into actionable insights to enable autonomous decision-making in space.

## Features

1. **Massive Dataset Storage**  
   - Store petabytes of raw satellite data and astrophysical observations in **Amazon S3**.
2. **Scalable Model Training**  
   - Train Cosmo on large GPU clusters through **AWS SageMaker** for efficient, high-performance compute.
3. **Real-Time Inference**  
   - Deploy inference endpoints using **AWS Lambda**, enabling immediate results for mission-critical decisions.
4. **Data-Driven Insights**  
   - Combine advanced NLP techniques with astrophysical modeling, producing precise insights for satellite mission planning and control.

## Architecture Overview

1. **Data Source**  
   - **Satellite Telemetry**: TLEs, ground station logs, sensor data.  
   - **Astrophysical Observations**: NOAA, NASA, space weather feeds, cosmic event data.

2. **Data Storage**  
   - **Amazon S3**: Central repository for raw and preprocessed data.  
   - Organize data into buckets for training (e.g., `/train`, `/validation`, `/test`).

3. **Model Pipeline**  
   1. **Preprocessing**: Convert satellite logs and astrophysical text data into tokenized sequences, store in S3.  
   2. **Training**: Launch an AWS SageMaker training job on GPU instances (e.g., `p3` or `p4` series).  
   3. **Evaluation**: Run test scripts to evaluate model performance, store metrics in S3.  
   4. **Deployment**: Package the trained model as a SageMaker endpoint or integrate with Lambda for real-time inference.

4. **Inference and Integration**  
   - **AWS Lambda**: Request the Cosmo model’s predictions in real-time.  
   - **API Gateway**: Optionally expose a REST/HTTPS endpoint for external clients.  
   - **Monitoring & Logging**: Collect logs in Amazon CloudWatch for ongoing analysis and troubleshooting.

## Prerequisites

- **AWS Account**: With sufficient permissions for S3, SageMaker, Lambda, etc.  
- **AWS CLI**: Installed and configured with proper credentials.  
- **Python 3.8+**: For data preprocessing and local development.  
- **Docker (Optional)**: If containerizing local builds or custom SageMaker containers.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone This Repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/cosmo-llm.git
   cd cosmo-llm
   ```

2. **Install Python Dependencies**  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   - Contains libraries like `boto3`, `transformers`, `torch`, etc.

3. **Configure AWS**  
   ```bash
   aws configure
   ```
   - Provide your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, default region, and output format.

4. **Set Up S3 Buckets**  
   - Create or specify your existing buckets to store raw data and model artifacts. For example:
     ```bash
     aws s3 mb s3://my-cosmo-train-bucket
     aws s3 mb s3://my-cosmo-output-bucket
     ```

5. **Prepare Training Data**  
   - Place or upload your satellite logs, astrophysical text data, etc., to the training S3 bucket:
     ```bash
     aws s3 cp data/ s3://my-cosmo-train-bucket/data/ --recursive
     ```

---

## Training Workflow on AWS SageMaker

1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   1. Run `preprocess_data.py` locally or in a SageMaker Processing Job.  
   2. Outputs tokenized or otherwise cleaned data to your S3 training bucket.

2. **Launch SageMaker Training**  
   1. Configure your training job in `train_model.py` (hyperparameters, instance type, etc.).  
   2. Run:
      ```bash
      python train_model.py
      ```
      This script automatically spawns a SageMaker training job, monitors progress, and stores model artifacts in `my-cosmo-output-bucket`.

3. **Evaluation**  
   - Use `evaluate_model.py` to measure the model’s accuracy, perplexity, or other relevant metrics against a held-out set.
   - Results are saved to S3 for inspection.

4. **Deployment**  
   1. Create a SageMaker endpoint:
      ```bash
      python deploy_model.py
      ```
   2. The endpoint provides a fully managed REST API for inference.  
   3. Optionally, integrate with Lambda for real-time triggers.

## Real-Time Inference with AWS Lambda

1. **Lambda Function**  
   - Define a Lambda function (e.g., `lambda_inference.py`) that loads the Cosmo model from SageMaker or directly if the model is small enough.
2. **Serverless Config**  
   - Adjust memory, timeout, and concurrency based on your inference performance needs.
3. **API Gateway Integration (Optional)**  
   - Expose a public HTTPS endpoint or use it internally for other AWS services to call.

## Best Practices

- **Use IAM Roles**: Attach roles to your SageMaker and Lambda services for secure S3 access.  
- **Version Data**: Keep track of data versions in S3 for reproducible experiments.  
- **Monitoring**: Leverage Amazon CloudWatch logs and metrics to monitor training and inference.  
- **Security**: Restrict access to model artifacts and limit network access on your SageMaker endpoints.
