# Cosmo: AI-Powered Language Model for Scientific Discovery and Physical Engineering

Cosmo is an AI-powered language model designed for advanced scientific computing and physical engineering. By leveraging **AWS S3** for large-scale data storage, **Databricks** for scalable data preparation and model training with Apache Spark, and **Kubernetes** for robust deployment, Cosmo transforms raw experimental data, time series, and sensor feeds into actionable insights for the physical sciences.

## Features

1. **Massive Dataset Storage**  
   - Store terabytes of raw experimental, sensor, and simulation data in **AWS S3**.

2. **Scalable Model Training**  
   - Fine-tune Cosmo on Databricks using Apache Spark for efficient, distributed training.

3. **Automated Data Analysis**  
   - Generate insights, summaries, and visualizations from raw data, time series, and sensor feeds.

4. **Robust Deployment**  
   - Deploy Cosmo on **Kubernetes** for seamless scaling and orchestration across cloud environments.

## Architecture Overview

1. **Data Source**  
   - **Scientific Observations & Simulations**: Experimental logs, sensor data, simulation outputs, research data.

2. **Data Storage**  
   - **AWS S3**: Central repository for raw data and processed artifacts, organized into buckets (e.g., `/train`, `/validation`, `/test`).

3. **Model Pipeline**  
   1. **Preprocessing**: Convert raw experimental and scientific data into tokenized sequences using Apache Spark on Databricks.  
   2. **Training**: Fine-tune the MPT‑30B base model on Databricks with distributed Spark jobs.  
   3. **Evaluation**: Run evaluation scripts to assess model performance (accuracy, perplexity) and save metrics back to S3.  
   4. **Deployment**: Package and deploy the trained model on Kubernetes for scalable inference.

4. **Inference and Integration**  
   - Expose the model via a REST API or integrate directly into your data pipelines, with logging and monitoring managed on Databricks and via Kubernetes.

## Prerequisites

- **AWS S3 Access**: An AWS account with permissions to create and access S3 buckets.  
- **Databricks Workspace**: Access to a Databricks environment configured for Apache Spark.  
- **Python 3.8+**: For data preprocessing and local development.  
- **Docker (Optional)**: For containerizing builds or custom deployments on Kubernetes.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone This Repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/cosmo-llm.git
   cd cosmo-llm
   ```

2. **Install Python Dependencies**  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   - Libraries include `boto3`, `transformers`, `torch`, etc.

3. **Configure AWS S3 Access**  
   - Set up your AWS S3 buckets (for example, create one for training data and one for model artifacts):
     ```bash
     aws s3 mb s3://my-cosmo-train-bucket
     aws s3 mb s3://my-cosmo-output-bucket
     ```

4. **Upload Your Training Data**  
   - Upload your experimental logs, sensor data, or simulation outputs to the training bucket:
     ```bash
     aws s3 cp data/ s3://my-cosmo-train-bucket/data/ --recursive
     ```

---

## Training Workflow on Databricks

1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Run `preprocess_data.py` on Databricks to load raw data from AWS S3, clean/tokenize it, and save the processed data back to S3.

2. **Launch Training**  
   - Configure your training parameters in `train_model.py` and execute the script on Databricks:
     ```bash
     python train_model.py
     ```
   - The training job leverages Apache Spark for distributed processing and stores model artifacts in your S3 output bucket.

3. **Evaluation**  
   - Use `evaluate_model.py` to assess the model’s performance on a held-out dataset, with results saved to S3.

4. **Deployment**  
   - Deploy the fine-tuned model on Kubernetes using your containerized solution:
     ```bash
     kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
     ```
   - This setup enables scalable, real-time inference.

## Best Practices

- **IAM Roles & Permissions:** Use IAM roles to securely grant Databricks and Kubernetes access to your S3 buckets.  
- **Data Versioning:** Maintain version control for datasets in S3 to ensure reproducible experiments.  
- **Monitoring:** Utilize Databricks logs and Kubernetes monitoring tools to track training progress and deployment performance.  
- **Security:** Secure S3 buckets and endpoints to protect sensitive research data.
